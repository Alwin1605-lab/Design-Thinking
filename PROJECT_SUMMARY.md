## 💡 Pro Tips

### Voice Recording
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Reduce background noise
- Use headphones with mic for best results
- Groq Whisper works in 90+ languages!

### Authenticator (TOTP)
- Set a stable TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY in Backend/.env for persistence across restarts
- Use Google Authenticator or Authy to scan the QR
- Store recovery codes out of band (future enhancement)

### Performance Optimization
- Compress images before upload
- Use lazy loading for issue lists
- Implement pagination (currently showing all)
- Add caching for categories

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit `.env` file
- Use strong JWT secrets
- Implement rate limiting (future)
- Add input validation (already done with Pydantic)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No pagination** - All issues load at once (fine for <1000 issues)
2. **No image compression** - Large images slow down upload
3. **No offline mode** - Requires internet (planned in FEATURES_GUIDE.md)
4. **Basic authentication** - No JWT tokens yet (uses localStorage)
5. **No SMS** - Only email notifications (WhatsApp recommended)

### Not Critical But Nice to Have
- Search functionality
- Issue filtering improvements
- Better error messages
- Loading animations
- Toast notifications instead of alerts
